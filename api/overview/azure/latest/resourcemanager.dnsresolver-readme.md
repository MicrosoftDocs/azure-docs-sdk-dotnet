# Azure Dns Resolver management client library for .NET - version 1.2.0 


Microsoft Azure Dns Private Resolver enables you to query Azure Dns private zones from an on-premises environment and vice versa without deploying VM based Dns servers.

This library supports managing Microsoft Azure Dns Resolver resources.

This library follows the [new Azure SDK guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html), and provides many core capabilities:

    - Support MSAL.NET, Azure.Identity is out of box for supporting MSAL.NET.
    - Support [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for distributed tracing.
    - HTTP pipeline with custom policies.
    - Better error-handling.
    - Support uniform telemetry across all languages.
